# Music_Store_Analysis_SQL

In this project, I applied my SQL skills to analyze data from a music store, showcasing a comprehensive approach to database management and data analysis. 

I started by creating a fully functional database in MS SQL Server, followed by importing all the necessary tables related to the music store's operations. The project then involved solving a series of data-driven queries, allowing me to extract valuable insights and demonstrate advanced SQL techniques. 

This project highlights my ability to handle real-world data scenarios, from database creation to complex query execution.

Hope you like it. ðŸ˜‰
